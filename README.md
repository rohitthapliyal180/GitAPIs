# GitAPIs

Git has APIs to get users, Repos, stargazers and watches. Which is very useful to analyse repositories and user action.

We are going to write a small code to demonstrate how you can get such details from github using APIs.

In this example we try to fetch the stargazers who starred the repo and when it was starred.This will help us to understand 
the per time interval when the given repo was starred.
